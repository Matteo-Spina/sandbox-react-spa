# quick info:
#
# <pattern> eol=crlf
#  Git normalize line endings for this file on checkin and 
#  convert them to CRLF when the file is checked out.
#
# <pattern> eol=lf
#  Git normalize line endings to LF on checkin and
#  prevents conversion to CRLF when the file is checked out.
#
# <pattern> -text
#  Git not to attempt any end-of-line conversion upon checkin or checkout.
#
# <pattern> text=auto
#  If Git thinks the content is text, file are converted to LF on checkin.
#  When the file has been committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.
